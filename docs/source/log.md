# The Journey

The ultimate aim is to create a language based on the NESA pseudocode that is capable of printing a series of Fibonacci numbers:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...

We originally broke this into issues which were asigned to individuals such as:
* write the ebnf
* write the railroad diagrams
* write the lexer etc.

However it quickly became apparent that this was a large and complex task and we ould be better to adopt the agile approach with eacxh 'sprint'representing a very small increment and students rotating the tasks so that each got a chance to develop proficiency in different tasks.
